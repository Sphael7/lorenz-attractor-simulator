# Lorenz Attractor Simulation

A 3D interactive simulation of the **Lorenz Attractor**, built using **HTML, CSS, and Three.js**.  
This project visualizes chaotic behavior in a dynamic, rotating 3D environment.

## Live Demo
You can try it online here:  
[https://sphael7.github.io/lorenz-attractor-simulator/](https://sphael7.github.io/lorenz-attractor-simulator/)

## Features
- Fully interactive 3D visualization of the Lorenz Attractor.
- Rotate the view using **mouse drag** or **touch gestures**.
- Zoom in/out using **mouse wheel** or **pinch on touch devices**.
- Dynamic trail with gradient color effect.
- Starfield background for better visual depth.

## Parameters
- σ (sigma) = 10  
- ρ (rho) = 28  
- β (beta) = 8/3  

These are standard parameters that generate the classical Lorenz attractor.

## How to Run Locally
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3. Interact with the simulation using your mouse or touch input.
